## ATmega32 Digital Clock & Multi-Function Utility üïí
This project is a comprehensive digital clock system built on the ATmega32 microcontroller. It goes beyond simple time-telling by integrating a stopwatch, a countdown timer, and a configurable alarm. All features are managed through an intuitive keypad interface and displayed on a 16x2 character LCD.
